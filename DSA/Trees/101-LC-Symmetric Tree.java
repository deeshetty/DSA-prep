// https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/

// Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).

 

// Example 1:


// Input: root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]
// Output: true
// Example 2:


// Input: root = [1,2,2,null,3,null,3]
// Output: false
 

// Constraints:

// The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
// -100 <= Node.val <= 100

 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}

//TC: O(n)
//SC: O(n) for the queue
//Here we use a queue to store pairs of nodes. We compare the left and right children of the nodes in each pair. If they are equal, we continue; if not, we return false. If both nodes are null, we continue to the next pair.
//This approach ensures that we check the symmetry of the tree in a level-order manner, which is efficient and straightforward.


//Can also be implemented with 2 stacks by pushing left child to 1 stack, right child to the other stack, and then comparing the top elements of both stacks. If they are equal, pop them and continue. If not, return false.
//This is similar to the queue approach but uses stacks instead. The logic remains the same:

//Note:
//Since in queue approach, we are pushing null nodes as well, we need to use LinkedList version, not ArrayDeque, as ArrayDeque does not allow null elements.
